  <p>Grand Theft Auto is a series of action-adventure games created by
    David Jones and Mike Dailly.[2] Later titles were developed under
    the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and
    Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development
    house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by
    its parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series references 
    the term "grand theft auto", used in the United States for motor vehicle theft.
