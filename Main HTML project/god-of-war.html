  <p>God of War is an action-adventure game franchise created by David Jaffe at
    Sony's Santa Monica Studio. It began in 2005 on the PlayStation 2 (PS2) 
    video game console and has become a flagship series for PlayStation,
    consisting of nine installments across multiple platforms. Based on
    ancient mythologies, the story follows Kratos, a Spartan warrior
    and later the Greek God of War, who was tricked into killing his
    family by his former master, the original Greek God of War Ares.
    This sets off a series of events that leads to wars with the different
    mythological pantheons. The Greek-based games see Kratos follow a path
    of vengeance due to the machinations of the Olympian gods, while the
    Norse-based games, which introduce his son Atreus as a secondary protagonist,
    show an older Kratos on a path of redemption and inadvertently coming into
    conflict with the Norse gods.
